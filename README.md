📘 Loan Approval Prediction System

A Machine Learning + Streamlit + MySQL Project

This project is an end-to-end Loan Approval Prediction System that uses machine learning to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected.
It includes:

✔ ML model training using MySQL data
✔ Data preprocessing + EDA
✔ A saved trained model (loan_approval_model.pkl)
✔ A Streamlit web app for real-time prediction
✔ Clean directory structure for deployment (Render / GitHub Pages / local)
